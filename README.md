# JavaScript: Fizz Buzz Generator Challenge

## Prerequisites

-   [Fizz buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)
-   [Iterators and generators - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators)
-   [function* - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*)
-   [Generator - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator)
-   [yield - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/yield)

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Install dependencies.
1.  Create and checkout a new branch to work on.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js). A pull
request is not required, but it is necessary if you want a code review.

You may wish to refer to [FAQs](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/)
related to [forking,
cloning](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone).

## Requirements

Describe behavioral requirements as you'll be using them in tests. That is,
list requirements in language that describes how the written code will be used,
not how it will be written, with the exception of constraints you may wish to
place on implementation. It's a good idea to include the below paragraph
verbatim.

You should be running `grunt nag` before diagnosing any bugs, since it finds
some of the most common sources of errors. After `grunt nag` passes, you should
run `grunt test` to run the included tests. Tests will tell you whether of not
you've met these requirements.

## Bonus

Bonuses are described after the requirements, if included. They should be worked
on **only after** passing requirements.

Sometimes, we ask questions that promote thinking critically about code.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `grunt nag`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains.
-   `grunt test`: runs any automated tests; may depend on `grunt build`.
-   `grunt`: runs both `nag` and then `test`
-   `grunt make-standard`: reformats all your code in the standard style.
